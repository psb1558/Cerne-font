      <h1>How Cerne Emulates a <span class="colorvar">Handwritten</span> Script</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>1. Emulating cursive</h2>
    <p>
      The Cerne font owes the greatest part of its distinctive look to its letterforms—but there’s
      much more to it than that. The scribe of the Book of
      Cerne wrote a cursive script, though one that leaned towards the formal:
      many of its letters are joined, as you can see by
      glancing at this brief extract from Book IV of Bede’s <i>Ecclesiastical
      History</i> (in the font’s historical mode):
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit" src="./images/Bede-sample-2.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      But you can’t make a cursive script by simply making letters bump against
      each other; the result of that would be a mess. For two letters to join,
      the shape of one or both must be adjusted. Consider, for example, the word <b>litteris</b>
      from line eight of our Bede extract. In the illustration below, the version of
      the word on the left uses only the Cerne font’s default letterforms,
      while the version on the right lets the font’s cursive flag fly:
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-small" src="./images/litteris.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      Of the eight letters of <b>litteris</b>, four (two on each end:
      <b>li</b> and <b>is</b>) match the
      default forms while the other four do not: these make a ligature
      (<b>tter</b>) in the middle of the
      word. In fact, the leftmost <b>t</b> joins with the unaltered <b>i</b> to
      make it a five-letter ligature.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ‘ligature’ we mean a sequence of letters that are (1) joined, and
      (2) altered in shape so as to make the join between letters look
      right. Most fonts for western languages handle ligatures by grouping connected
      letters into a single ‘glyph’—a unit of type that corresponds roughly to
      individual pieces of metal type in pre-digital printing. Early
      typefounders used to group
      several letters on a single piece of type when the letters touched or
      overlapped, as is the case with the standard f-ligatures in the JuniusX
      font:
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-tiny" src="./images/juniusxligs.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      For JuniusX (and many other fonts, both metal and digital, since the time
      of Gutenberg), the designer <b>anticipated all the ligatures that the
      font needed and designed each one as a unit</b>. This doesn't work for Cerne,
      and a moment’s thought will explain why. Scribes writing out texts by hand
      have no need to confine themselves to a fixed number of predefined
      ligatures; rather, they apply rules for joining letters that allow for a
      nearly infinite number of ligatures of arbitrary length. It is impossible
      for a font designer to anticipate all the ligatures that might be needed
      for a font like Cerne,
      and if it were possible, doing so would make the font impossibly large.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, does Cerne form its ligatures? The technology that accomplishes
      this task is related to that used to handle scripts
      far more complex than the Latin script used for most western languages.
      Of these the best known is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script_in_Unicode">Arabic</a>,
      which among other complications requires that many letters vary their
      form in order to join or harmonize with surrounding letters. Fonts for these
      scripts work in part by substituting variant letterforms for the defaults.
      These variants are called <b>Contextual Alternates</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To form the word <b>litteris</b>, a program called a ‘shaping engine’,
      a piece of the machinery for displaying text on your screen, begins
      with the word <b>litteris</b> as it appears on the left in the
      illustration above, and applies
      to it rules that are written into the font, substituting characters one
      by one or in pairs, until it produces the final shape:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text before shaping.</li>
      <li>
        Adjacent <b>t</b>’s altered to join cleanly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjacent <b>e</b> and <b>insular r</b> altered.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>t</b> altered when preceded by <b>i</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>t</b> altered when followed by <b>high e</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The process looks involved, but the shaping engine handles it speedily
      and invisibly, so that the
      reader is (ideally) completely unaware of it. And from the font
      maker’s point of view, designing a few variant shapes of <b>t</b>,
      <b>e</b>, and <b>r</b> and writing the rules that make all this magic
      happen is far less work than designing perhaps dozens of ligatures
      involving those letters—and thousands more to take account of the other
      letters of the alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a compact font that can be quickly downloaded with a
      web page and yet contains within it the thousands of ligatures needed
      to approximate the look of a hand-written medieval script.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Varying letterforms</h2>
    <p>
      In any script produced by hand, letterforms are highly variable. This
      variability contributes greatly to the beauty of handwriting.
      Some variability
      is a natural byproduct of the fact that a scribe is not a machine, while
      some is the result of scribal habit or whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer, of course, is a machine, and it is incapable of whimsy, so
      reproducing the variability of handwriting is difficult, to say the least.
      But a computer can give the <i>impression</i> of variability. It can
      employ pseudo-random algorithms, for example, to vary letterforms (my
      <a href="https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-font">Joscelyn</a> font uses
      this approach for the various shapes of the letter <b>h</b>). The Cerne
      font may at some point employ a system like this, but for now it takes
      two approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first approach is to give users the ability to choose variant letterforms
      themselves. The second is to vary letterforms automatically.
      For example, consider these two versions of the word
      <b>passuum</b> (in historical mode):
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-small" src="./images/passuum.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      The most obvious difference between the two words is that the one on
      the right uses a ligature for the doubled insular <b>s</b> while the
      one on the left does not. Both are consistent with the usage of the
      Cerne scribe, whose rule for producing this ligature seems to have been
      (admittedly oversimplifying a bit) “whenever I feel like it.” The Cerne
      font does not attempt to reproduce the scribe’s whimsy, but instead
      includes the ligature in the <b>dlig</b> (Discretionary Ligatures) feature. Users can turn
      this feature on for words with doubled <b>s</b> when they want to—when
      whimsy strikes. Another way to produce variant letterforms is with
      the features
      <b>ss04</b> (Stylistic Set 4, “Word-final forms”), which has no effect
      except at the ends of words, and
      <b>ss05</b> (Stylistic Set 5, “Miscellaneous alternates”). The
      number of alternates available via these methods is small but growing
      (as of version 0.010).
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you look more carefully at the word on the left, you may notice
      that the two instances of <b>s</b> and the two instances of <b>u</b>
      are different from each other. The differences are subtle, since this
      scribe’s work is remarkably uniform, and
      extreme variations can be distracting. Most readers won’t notice
      the differences, but this feature still supports a general impression of
      handwritten variability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubled letters vary automatically in Cerne via the <b>calt</b> (Contextual
      Alternates) feature, which is on by default in every major application
      except for Microsoft Word, where it must be turned on explicitly.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Inside a Color Font</h2>
    <p>
      You know, of course, that a conventional font can be rendered in any
      color: color text is all over the web, and
      it’s frequently used for titles and running heads in printed books. A
      color font is different from a conventional font in that the colors
      in which text is rendered are chosen by the font designer, not by the
      font’s user. Further, a single glyph in a color font can
      have any number of colors and combine them in any number of ways.
      Cerne has five colors:
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-tiny" src="./images/Cerne-colors.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      These are based on colors found in the Book of Cerne, but to compensate
      for the degradation of the colors over the centuries, and the
      darkening of the parchment, the last four of them,
      used for decoration, have been adjusted with reference to
      pigments likely to have been used in the ninth century: cinnabar, yellow
      ochre, verdigris, and azurite. The saturation of these colors has
      been reduced so as to increase contrast with the text color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the font, each character consists of at least two <b>layers</b>, and
      often more—a layer being like a character (or glyph), but meant to be
      combined with other layers. Each layer is rendered in one of the font’s
      five colors. For an illustration, let’s look at the
      letter <b>M</b>,
      which has two fill colors (the background, by the way, is copied from
      images of the book itself, but lightened by about 50%):
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-tiny" src="./images/M-sample.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      The font contains four layers for this glyph. The first is a <b>fallback
      layer</b>. It’s there to guarantee that the font will be usable by
      applications that know nothing about color fonts. This layer has no
      color, and it is ignored by applications that recognize color fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second layer contains everything in the text color—a dark reddish brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third layer contains everything in red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth layer contains everything in blue.
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox">
      <img class="center-fit-small" src="./images/M-layers.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      The application that displays color text renders the three color layers
      one by one, aligning them exactly. If you’re
      thinking that this is an inefficient way of going about things, you
      may be right—but modern font technology is highly optimized with respect
      to both speed and file size: the web version of Cerne (for which file
      size is important) is tiny, and if modern displays render a color font
      more slowly than a conventional one, the difference is not noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this, the details are arcane. There are several competing formats
      for color fonts. The two most widely used are the COLR format, developed
      by Microsoft, and the SVG format, supported by Adobe applications, among
      others. The desktop version of Cerne packages both of these formats in a
      single file. The
      web version uses only the COLR format, since all major browsers
      recognize that. The web version including only a single format has the
      advantage of keeping the file small: with a moderately fast internet
      connection it can be downloaded almost instantly.
